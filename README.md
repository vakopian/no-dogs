# no-dogs
Reasons why you should not have a dog

* Most of the time the dog will die before the owner
* Dogs cost tons of money to train, to feed, to immunize, to keep healthy
* Dogs are messy, they poop and pee everywhere
* Dogs are smelly, their smell gets on everything, including the whole house
* Dogs shed their fur, which is very unhealthy and could cause alergies, asthma and other diseases 
* Dogs are a big libality, in case they bite someone
* Dogs need constant care, like washing them
* Dogs can get fleas, which could become dangerous for owners
* When you have a dog traveling becomes a problem - you either need a dogsitter, or you need to take the dog with you. Many airlines don't allow dogs. Even worse, some countries don't allow bringing dogs in (or have long quarantines).
* Most work places are not dog friendly, so the dog may need to stay home alone, which is unnatural and is kind of cruel treatment for it.
* Dogs are often requested by kids, but the responsibility for caring for the dogs almost always falls on the parents. In many cases, parents eventually decide to "dispose" of the dog in various ways, some rather inhumain.
* Most male dogs get neutered, which is also a cruel treatment of the poor animal
